### Networks

Each network is connected to a Crowbar Role (see API guide for more information) named =network-[network name]=.

Within each network, you may define one or more subnets and a router.

### Net-Node Map

Shows the connection (based on node-roles) between nodes and networks defined in the system.

### Bus Interfaces

Defined the physical bus mapping for different types of servers.  This is needed to ensure that NIC enumeration is consistent for Crowbar.
